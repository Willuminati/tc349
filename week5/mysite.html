<h1> Results </h1>
<p> These were the results of the card sorting for the portfolio site I planned out. 
Some of the content I had varying result so I chose not to include it. There were 3 people
who participated in the card sorting which allowed me to come up with this table. I think
that with proper UI design these format could look pretty clean and nice. </p>
