<h1> What this means </h1>
<p> For this card sort I used the web application conceptcodify. I used categories in order to make it clearer for the participants. Results from me and two other people where then compiled
and the results were displayed. The results from the card sorting were very similar amongst the individuals different from the Nasa site.
The result would have a site that would look much more modern that what it currently is.  </p>
